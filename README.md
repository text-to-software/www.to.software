Requirements are typically written in natural language. 

However, hardly any automated tools exist that translate natural language texts into software artifacts. 
 
 We propose to adapt recent advances in natural language processing and semantic technologies to generate DSL language which can generate the source code, from natural language input. 
 
It might even be possible to generate executable test cases. 
An intermediate step would be to generate tests from API documentation (which would also be a useful capability in itself). 

Though speculative, a determined, long-term effort in translating text to software could automate and accelerate software development to an unprecedented degree.
